END OF DAY / UPDATE CONTEXT ACCORDING TO CONTEXT PROTOCOL below
============================================================
CONTEXT PROTOCOL (DO NOT EDIT OR COMPRESS)
============================================================
Version: 1
Context_Session_Count: 2          # Increase by 1 for each major “day session”
Context_Total_Budget_Lines: 500   # Target compressed size for this file

Purpose:
- This file is a long-lived, machine-readable knowledge-transfer document.
- It encodes project-specific conventions, invariants, and design intent.
- The actual codebase (SQL/Java/Servlets/Tests/React) remains the primary
  source of truth; this file explains “how to read and extend it”.

Compression / Fairness Principle:
- Let N = Context_Session_Count (number of major sessions summarized).
- After compression, this file should be ≈ Context_Total_Budget_Lines lines.
- Each session’s knowledge should have comparable informational weight
  (roughly 1/N of the file, up to judgment).
- As N grows, older sessions are summarized more aggressively, but never
  entirely erased.

Update Protocol (for future ChatGPT sessions):
1) When the user uploads this `context.txt` + code and clearly indicates
   “END OF DAY / UPDATE CONTEXT ACCORDING TO CONTEXT PROTOCOL”:
   - Read `context.txt` fully and inspect the current code.
   - Increment Context_Session_Count by 1 in the CONTEXT PROTOCOL header only.
2) Append a new “SESSION <N> — KNOWLEDGE SUMMARY” block at the *end* of the
   KNOWLEDGE REGION summarizing what is NEW/CHANGED today:
   - New conventions, schema changes, endpoint behavior, invariants.
   - Do NOT restate what is obviously encoded in the current code or
     already clearly described in previous session blocks.
3) If total length > Context_Total_Budget_Lines:
   - Compress older session sections:
     • Merge duplicates.
     • Remove verbose narrative.
     • Replace long examples with rules or references to code/REST docs.
   - Prefer compressing content that is now clearly represented in the
     codebase (schema, servlet endpoints, tests).
   - Every session must retain at least a concise summary of:
     • What was done that session.
     • What rules/invariants it introduced or changed.
4) DO NOT:
   - Modify or delete this CONTEXT PROTOCOL block.
   - Compress lines outside the KNOWLEDGE REGION markers.

Knowledge Region Markers:
- Only lines between the following markers may be edited/compressed:
  - “=== BEGIN KNOWLEDGE REGION ===”
  - “=== END KNOWLEDGE REGION ===”
