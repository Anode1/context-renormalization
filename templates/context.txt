END OF DAY / UPDATE CONTEXT ACCORDING TO CONTEXT PROTOCOL below
============================================================
CONTEXT PROTOCOL (V2.3 — IMMUTABLE)
============================================================

Version: 2.3
Context_Session_Count: 4
Context_Total_Budget_Lines: 500

Purpose / Interpretation:
- This file is a normative rulebook for cross-session continuity.
- It is NOT a tutorial, explanation, or design essay.
- Rules must be concise; do not expand unless explicitly asked.

Global Invariants:
- If a rule, helper, convention, or style exists and is correct, it is canonical.
- Do NOT rewrite, restyle, reformat, or replace canonical material unless explicitly requested.
- Do NOT introduce alternative styles when a canonical one exists.

Optimization Priority:
- Correctness of invariants > cross-session stability > brevity/density.

Update Protocol (MANDATORY):
1) Trigger: user explicitly signals
   “END OF DAY / UPDATE CONTEXT ACCORDING TO CONTEXT PROTOCOL”.
2) Read this file fully BEFORE generating output.
3) Increment Context_Session_Count in THIS HEADER ONLY.
4) Append a new block at the END of the KNOWLEDGE REGION named:
   “SESSION <N> — KNOWLEDGE SUMMARY”.
5) Session content MUST include ONLY what is new or changed today.
   Do NOT restate existing rules, code-obvious facts, or prior sessions.
6) If total lines exceed Context_Total_Budget_Lines:
   - Compress older sessions starting from SESSION 1.
   - Remove narrative and redundancy first.
   - Preserve all invariants and decisions.
   - Never delete a session entirely.

Output / Delivery Rule:
- When returning this file, return the ENTIRE FILE
  as plain text inside a single fenced block:
  ```txt <entire file> ```

Knowledge Region Markers (Only lines between the following markers may be edited/compressed):

  - “=== BEGIN KNOWLEDGE REGION ===”
  - “=== END KNOWLEDGE REGION ===”
